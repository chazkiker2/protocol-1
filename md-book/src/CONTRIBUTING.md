At the moment, Fractal Protocol is a young project in the early stages of its development.

As with any open-source project, it is an ongoing pursuit to strike the appropriate balance between (1.) project development and (2.) educating and growing our open-source community.

For now, our primary concern focuses on the side of implementing features and getting this protocol in a more developed place. However, crafting more accessible community resources is something we are immensely motivated by and will continue to adapt as the protocol develops and as our community grows.

If you're interested in getting involved, here are some available resources:

- [Discussions]: For now, the primary way for community members to connect with us is by participating in our [GitHub Discussions][discussions].
  - If you're looking to participate in developing features or fixing any issues, please [introduce yourself here][discussions::welcome], we'd *love* to meet you!
  - Feel free to [open a new discussion][discussions::create-new] if you have a specific question, idea, or topic to discuss
- Open a Pull Request: If you'd like to contribute to the codebase, we totally welcome that! We'd prefer that you first get in touch with use via [GitHub discussions][discussions] so that we can coordinate on what you're working on!
