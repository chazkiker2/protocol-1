# üëãüèΩ Welcome!

Fractal Protocol is an open-source, zero-margin protocol that defines a basic standard to exchange user information fairly and openly, ensuring a high-quality version of the free internet.

## Want to help?

Great! At the moment, Fractal Protocol is a young project in the early stages of its development.

As with any open-source project, it is an ongoing pursuit to strike the appropriate balance between (1.) project development and (2.) educating and growing our open-source community.
