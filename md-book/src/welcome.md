TODO: describe how to get in touch and chat with us.

- is there any async platform that's more casual/conversational than GitHub Discussions that we could use?
  - the rust-lang community uses Zulip extensively, which I'm personally a big fan of.
  - I've also seen some great communities in Discord.
