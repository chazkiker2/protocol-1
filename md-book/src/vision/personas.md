# Fractal Protocol Personas

## What is this?

We've created seven agile-style personas that we use to guide our thinking. Six of these characters are protagonists of our stories, one is an antagonist (Manny). They help us to think about the different kinds of priorities and expectations that people bring to Fractal Protocol. Having names and personalities also makes the stories much more fun and approachable.
